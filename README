*Checksum Checker*
This is a  pretty simple application which i wrote to help verify downloads.  On windows there is no simple way to 
check the hash of a file.  This small application will generate the hash of a file (SHA1, SHA256 or MD5) and will 
verify it against the checksum you paste in the comparison field.  Thats it, nothing fancy but it does the trick.
